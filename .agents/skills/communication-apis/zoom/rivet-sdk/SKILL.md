# Zoom Rivet SDK

Use this skill when building a server-side Zoom integration with Rivet rather than hand-rolled API and webhook plumbing.

## Workflow

1. Confirm Rivet is the right abstraction for the integration’s REST, webhook, auth, and deployment needs.
2. Model the modules: app configuration, OAuth, API clients, webhook handlers, and business workflow handlers.
3. Implement the smallest authenticated API call and webhook receiver before composing multi-module flows.
4. Keep deployment constraints explicit, especially Lambda-style receivers and environment variable handling.
5. Debug by checking app credentials, token refresh, webhook signature handling, module wiring, and framework version drift.
